Celeste Classic,Gameboy Advance,Completed,Physical,Normal,"A tiny, super satisfying platforming challenge. The controls feel tight and responsive, great visuals and music. My first time climbing the 30 stages took me about 1 hour, with hundreds of deaths. I kept coming back to replay it, the RA challenges were a good motivator. Looking at some of the challenges (specifically the deathless and speedrun ones), I thought to myself \""I'm never getting that\"". Fast forward a couple weeks, and I'm breezing through the game like it was nothing. It wasn't long before those achievements which once seemed impossible popped up on my screen. This game has a great difficulty curve, and is very fun to master. It's a benchmark I Compare other GBA titles to."

Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle,Sega Megadrive,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"Got gifted this by a friend on Steam. This game clearly shows it's age, with it's flat, boring graphics and unsatisfying platforming. Used savestates to beat the final boss."

L'Abbaye des Morts,Sega Megadrive,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"An obscure and challenging homebrew puzzle platformer. While slow and frustrating at times, I found it fun and engaging exploring deeper into the murky depths of the Abbey. I managed to make it most of the way through the game legitimately, but the spike in difficulty for the final boss, plus the requirement to get all the crosses, Forced me to use save states to win."
Ristar,Sega Megadrive,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"A charming, fun platformer with great music and graphics! My fav genesis game so far gameplay-wise. Difficulty felt really well balanced, Minus a few bosses. (Used savestates to beat the last boss)"
Sonic The Hedgehog 2,Sega Megadrive,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"I'm not the biggest fan of classic Sonic gameplay, but I still found this game pretty entertaining. The biggest standout here is the music, dang those tracks are catchy! Had to use savestates to get past Metropolis Zone."

Pikmin,Nintendo GameCube,Completed,Physical,Normal,"An all-time personal favorite. The first entry in the Pikmin series has an indescribable mood that the later games never quite recaptured. The isolation, the beautiful natural environments, the raw danger and brutality of the enemies, and the intense time constraints put on the player. All of these work to create a challenging yet rewarding game experience. Returning to complete the RetroAchievements trophies really put my skills to the test, with the ""12 Day Challenge"" and the Challenge Mode achievements being particularly difficult"

Legend of Mana,Playstation,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"This game showed a lot of promise. I'd heard lots of good reviews, plus the soundtrack composed by Yoko Shimomura and gorgeous pixel graphics made this seem like a slam dunk. Unfortunately I had a tough time enjoying this game. The clunky controls, bizarre translation, lackluster story, and downright baffling quest progression made beating this game a chore. I found myself getting lost and having to look up guides multiple times during the playthrough."

Final Fantasy X,Playstation 2,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"My first Final Fantasy game I completed, which changed my perspective on the series as a whole. Unlike other entries, the RPG elements here were super fresh and engaging. Each party member had their own unique strengths which made them feel vital to the team. I found myself shuffling between them often, and struggling to pick a favorite (Rikku, Tidus and Kimari might be my top picks). The difficulty curve felt natural, no mindless grinding to prepare for any bosses, gratuitous backtracking, or any section that dragged on for too long. The story was beautiful and heartbreaking. From the first cutscene, I knew it was gonna hit hard, but I still wasn't prepared for that devastating ending. Incredible music, voice acting, and art direction that still holds up 20 years later. While it may not be for everyone, this game hit very close to home for me. An all-time favorite."
God of War,Playstation 2,Beaten,Physical,Normal,"A brutal and satisfying hack-and-slash adventure. This game delivers super fun and engaging combat, puzzles, and cutscenes, all with a level of presentation and polish rarely seen in the PS2 era. One of the coolest parts of this game is it's boss battles, which pits you against everything from towering giants to armies of shadowy doppelgangers. When you win, you feel like you have truly conquered your foes. This game's impact on the industry is clear, with many other titles taking heavy inspiration from it's combo and progression systems."

It somehow manages to feel like a DS-era Pokemon game, while running on the GBA. The QOL features like unlimited inventory, better TM/HM handling, Pokemon search tools make me wonder how I ever tolerated the original games. There's a great difficulty curve, and I was able to complete the base game even with my meager Pokemon skills."
